# Research
This repository is mainly focused on the research domain. Currently, I'm working on research paper in the data science field using machine learning.

I always thrive on data in search of some meaningful and productive insights. My research motive was to introduce a new approach to detect cyberbullying on our Bengali language. Hence the Hybrid Ensemble approach using the voting classifier introduced, which yields the best performance with an accuracy of 85%.
Also performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to get precise insights from the dataset so that the model evaluation and prediction can be perfectly measured.
